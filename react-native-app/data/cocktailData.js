    "name": "Gin",
    "history": "Gin traces its origins to the early 17th century in the Netherlands, where a physician named Franciscus Sylvius is often credited with creating 'jenever,' a juniper-based medicinal spirit.

During the 'Gin Craze' of the 18th century, its popularity soared among the English working classes.",
